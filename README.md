# Image-Classification-using-DEiT-Model
#This project implements an image classification system using the DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformers) model to classify images into four disaster-related categories: hurricane, earthquake, wildfire, and not meaningful. The model is trained on image data that has been split into training, validation, and test sets.
